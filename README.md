# TrueSkillModelWorlds
TrueSkill model implemented on League of Legends world championship 2024. 
**trueskill.py** is used to calculate the skill levels of all major regions in League of Legends pro play using data from each region. 

**calibration.py** can then be used to compile all teams participating in Worlds 2024 and weigh these against each other based on previous international performances. 

**prediction.py** can be used to simulate a number of games that have already happened at Worlds 2024 and see if the predicted outcome matches the actual outcome. The skill levels are then adjusted to keep skill levels of the teams fresh throughout the entire World championship competition.

**simulate_one_game.py** can be used to predict the outcome of a game between two teams participating at worlds.
